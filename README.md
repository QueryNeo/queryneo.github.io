i do the websites for me to do the funny


Hello!
1st: what're you doing here? Get outta here!
2nd: You can see how poorly i've organised my codebase. my house is quite cluttered, im a hoarder, sorry. look around to find some of the images you've seen on the website.

Bet you have a burning question:
 Why is there two stylesheets used for LITERALLY TWO seperate pages??? answer: i'm lazy and couldn't be bothered to merge the two pages i made.

 if you actually bothered to read this readme, send me an image of frog(s)(awesome); i'm counting the people who've found this.
 Anyways...

 # Why make????

 funny, next question.

 # How make????
 using fingers and screen smashing, next question.

 # when make????
 Whilst on my holiday in Singapore, Very good holiday! (and also for preparations for my exams!)

 # why have you done this for realsies??

 train my programming skills for real-life experience. taking CompSci at Uni-Level and I need to be proficient in different languages (3 different ones covered by this current branch, might've changed in the time since)
